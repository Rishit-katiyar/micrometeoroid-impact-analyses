## Introduction

The Micro Meteoroid Impact Analysis Simulation allows you to explore the effects of micrometeoroids on spacecraft shields. Micrometeoroids are tiny, high-speed particles that pose a risk to spacecraft integrity, necessitating protective shielding for critical components.

### What are Micrometeoroids?

Micrometeoroids are small particles, typically ranging from a few micrometers to a few millimeters in size, that travel through space at high velocities. They are remnants of asteroids, comets, or collisions between larger celestial bodies. Micrometeoroids can pose a significant threat to spacecraft and satellites, as their high speeds make them capable of penetrating spacecraft hulls, damaging critical components, and causing operational disruptions.

### Importance of Impact Analysis

Understanding the effects of micrometeoroid impacts is crucial for spacecraft design, mission planning, and risk assessment. By simulating micrometeoroid impacts on shields, engineers and researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of shield materials, design configurations, and mitigation strategies. This simulation provides valuable insights into shield performance under various impact scenarios, helping to enhance spacecraft resilience and mission success.

## Installation

To run this simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: The simulation is written in Python. If Python is not installed on your system, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **matplotlib**: A Python plotting library used for visualization.
- **numpy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/micrometeoroid-impact-analyses.git
cd micrometeoroid-impact-analyses
```

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment allows you to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

#### Create Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

#### Activate Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Unix/Linux/MacOS**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the simulation, run the Python script `MicroMeteoroidImpactAnalysisSimulation.py`. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize simulation parameters or proceed with the default settings.

```bash
python MicroMeteoroidImpactAnalysisSimulation.py
```

## Customization

You can customize various simulation parameters such as shield dimensions, number of micrometeoroids, and their characteristics through the user interface. Experiment with different settings to explore diverse scenarios and analyze the impact of micrometeoroids on the shield.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or execution of the simulation, try the following troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Check Python Version

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can check the Python version using the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Verify Dependencies

Make sure that the required dependencies (matplotlib and numpy) are installed in your virtual environment. You can verify the installed packages using pip:

```bash
pip list
```

If any dependencies are missing, install them using the `pip install` command mentioned in the installation instructions.

### 3. Virtual Environment Activation

If you encounter issues with activating the virtual environment, double-check the commands for your operating system. Ensure that you are using the correct path to the virtual environment's activation script.

### 4. File Permissions

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute Python scripts and install packages on your system. If you encounter permission denied errors, try running the commands with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` on Unix/Linux systems).

### 5. Update Git Repository

If you experience issues with cloning the repository, ensure that you have the correct URL and that your internet connection is stable. You can also try updating your Git client to the latest version.
